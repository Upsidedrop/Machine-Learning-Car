# Machine Learning Car
To view the code and sprites and stuff go to "Machine Learning Car/Assets/".
To run the game, download the repository (or at least the "game" folder) and head to "Game/Machine Learning Car.exe/". You need the whole folder to sucessfully run the game.
The Ai will take a little bit of time to figure ot the track but once it gets back the second turn it does pretty well. the main reason that the second turn is difficult for it is that it's the ONLY RIGHT TURN IN THE ENTIRE TRACK.
